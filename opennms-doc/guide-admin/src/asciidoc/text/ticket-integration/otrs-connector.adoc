= OTRS connector

The OTRS connector allows one to create and manage OTRS tickets from OpenNMS alarms.

When integration is enabled, 3 new buttons get displayed on the "alarm details" pages ("Create ticket", "Update ticket", "Close ticket"), +
and the alarm 'state is synchronized with the corresponding ticket 'state in OTRS (ie: ticket can be closed either from OTRS or openNMS, +
its state will be reflected on the other side). Also, buttons are activated/deactivated accordingly. 

== Compatibility

This connector is compatible with OTRS versions 3.1 and above.
